## About <a name = "about"></a>
This project involved filling psuedo code for a ray tracing algorithm. The script gets passed in a JSON object file and it draws the scene in png images. You can also create your own scenes by creatng your own JSON file.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and purposes.

### Prerequisites
What things you need and how to install them.

- [pypy3](https://pypy.org/download.html) to get faster raytracing times

## Usage
Run the `raytrace.py` file with pypy3 and a chosen scene and it will begin generating the image.

```
$ path/to/pypy3 raytrace.py scenes/scene.json
```
