# Raytrace Project
This project involved filling psuedo code for a ray tracing algorithm. The script gets passed in a JSON object file and it draws the scene in png images. You can also create your own scenes by creatng your own .json file.

Recommend using [pypy3](https://pypy.org/download.html) to get faster raytracing times.

## Usage
```
$ path/to/pypy3 raytrace.py scenes/01_sphere.json
```
